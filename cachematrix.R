## There are two functions below
#makeCacheMatrix - for creating a matrix
#cacheSolve - to calculate the inverse of matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix

## Function to create new matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Function to Calculate reverse of the matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
